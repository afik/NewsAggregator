Age 1.0 (The Invasion of Worms - to the Awakening of Trishula)

The Ancient Era:
-The "Sacred" created the "Vylon", Machine Weapons that are impervious to the corruption of "Vers"
-The "Sacred" sealed away the "Invers"

The Era of the Ice Barrier's Creation:
-"Prior of the Ice Barrier" sealed away the Three Dragons

The Current Era:
-The Surface Tribes descend into an era of chaos and battles
-The "N Nebula Meteorite" falls upon the DT World
-The Appearance of Worms:
・Each Tribe tried to expand their territory by waging war on another, just as it seemed that this conflict would never end, it did in an unexpected way - the appearance of invaders from outer space, the "Worms"
・The "Worms" were organisms that were attached to the N Nebula Meteorite. In the process of adapting to various environments, they eventually became the "Worms" that would travel around space invading and devouring plaents
-The warring tribes agreed to a ceasefire
-The all-out war against the "Worms" began
-Although many "Worms" were easily defeated, those that remained rapidly evolved and multiplied
-The all-out war against the "Worms":
・To deal with these unknown invaders who appeared like ants and cannot communicate with, the tribes agreed to a ceasefire. Each tribe then used their own ways of dealing with the "Worms"
・The First Ice Barrier Dragon Brionac released - against the massive flood of invaders, the "Ice Barrier" released Brionac, the first Dragon. It used its great ice powers to defeat many invaders
・The Other Tribes - the other tribes also sent out their most powerful members to fight against the "Worms". Well known warriors on the battlefield like X-Saber Urbellum, Mist Valley Falcon, and Flamvell Devil could be seen annihilating the waves of "Worms"
・"Worm" Evolution - the continual onslaught against the "Worms" actually served as a catalyst for their evolution, and new forms like "Worm Illidan" that could withstand the continual attacks began to appear
-Due to Invasion of "Worms", some tribes were wiped out
-The remaining tribes began to discuss a counter strategy
-The formation of "Ally of Justice":
・The various tribes realized that they could not win against the "Worms" fighting alone, so the four most influential tribes "Ice Barrier", "Mist Valley", "Flamvell", and "X-Saber" decided to work together. The AOJ was formed and their first order of business was to develop a series of new weapons to fight against the "Worms"
-The AOJ weapons began to be used in various battles
・While the first AOJ like Unknown Crusher, Thousand Arms, Garadholg, and Clausolas were created by the tribes individually, their first combined venture Catastor truly shined on the battlefield
-The "Worms" encounter the "Genex"
・The "Genex" were quietly working on improving the environment when they encountered the "Worms". Realizing that these invaders were polluting and destroying the environment, the "Genex" sprung into action
・"Genex Controller", as the central figure, can combine with other "Genex" to amplify their power
-The AOJ researchers discovered the existence of the "Genex", and began to do research on them
-The ever-evolving "Worms" began to show signs of high intelligence
・The "Worms" that survived the many battles began to evolve into a state of high intelligence. Ones like "Worm Noble" led the lower "Worm" ranks and turned them from a mindless mass into a group with order
-The "X-Sabers" were pushed to a dire situation
-The birth of the "XX-Sabers"
・As the battles with the "Worms" waged on, the "X-Saber" warriors were wounded and needed rest. Their leader "Gottoms" selected a group to become the "XX-Saber" to reenter the battle
・Many "X-Saber" warriors like "Pashul" lost parts of their body in the war, but they remained undeterred and continued fighting using artificial parts
・The "XX-Sabers" continued to be lead by "Gottoms". The research done with the AOJ allowed them to incorporate high-technology in their fighting
-The "Worms" invade Naturia Forest
・The battles against the "Worms" raged on, until it consumed the entire continent in warfare. The sticky tentacles of the "Worms" set their sights on the forest were the "Naturia" quietly lived. To protect themselves, the residents fought back
・The residents of Naturia Forest like "Beast" do not like battling, but in the face of their beautiful forest being destroyed by the invaders, they bravely charged forth
-"Field Marshal" bravely stood on the battlefield
・The sight of "Field Marshal" bravely standing and fighting in the battlefield was a beacon of trust to the many warriors. And yet in an intense battle, "Field Marshal" sacrificed itself to take out many "Worms". Realizing that it was impossible to repair it, the AOJ left it behind.
・As the AOJ lacked the proper technology to create a circuit that could control something as massive as the "Field Marshal", they used "Spare Genex" whom they discovered as the control system. What happened to "Spare Genex" in the end as "Field Marshal" fell can be seen on "Final Gesture" (**** you TCG, it should be Final Synchro, third **** up to the DT story gg no re)
-The discovery of a new type of matter in the N Nebula Meteorite
-The completion of "Ally Mind"
・The research done on the "Meteorite" that's though to have came from the "Worms" home planet discovered a new type of matter that created the "Ally Mind". Installing this on to the current weapons vastly improved the AIs of the "Ally of Justice" weapons
・The AOJ still lacked the technology to minimize the size of "Ally Mind", but its high Tuning abilities greatly improved the performance of the machines
-New weapons with the sole purpose of capturing the "Worms" like "Enemy Catcher" began to be mass produced
-The "Mist Valley" leaves the AOJ
・The "Mist Valley" began to doubt the actions of the AOJ after they used not only the enemy, but also the "Genex", who cannot speak up against their treatment. This small doubt began to be amplified by the "Fabled" like "Raven". This eventually turned into a huge distrust, and so the "Mist Valley" left the AOJ, all according to the "Fabled's" machination
-The AOJ began to develop the "Cosmic Gateway", but it failed to accomplish what they wanted to use it for
-The "Fabled" revives
・Whether it was because of the turmoil on the surface, or because of the AOJ's dimensional tampering experiments, the "Fabled" who were said to have been slumbering since the Ancient Era awoke. The high-tier "Fabled" led their subordinates to the Surface World
・The creed of the "Fabled" is simple: be true to your desires. And so they did, instead of helping the Surface Tribes, they entered the battle purely for their own enjoyment
-The "Genex" began to customize themselves to be more suited to battle like "Army Genex" or "Windfarm Genex"
-"Fabled Leviathan" arrives on the Surface World
-The "Fabled" began attacking the "Jurrac"
・The just-awakened "Fabled" attacked the "Jurrac" whose territory happened to be in close proximity. Because this area also coincidentally had not been attacked by the "Worms" all that much, the "Jurrac" launched an all-out assault against the "Fabled"
・Receiving far more resistance than they had first imagined, the "Fabled" like "Leviathan", "Miztoji", "Krus", and "Soulkius" actually showed an expression of joy in knowing that they prey was not so easily hunted down
・The prideful "Jurrac" refused to be hunted, and launched and all-out assault against the "Fabled". The bonds they shared with their friends and family allowed the Fires that naturally surrounded their body to turn into a blazing Inferno, scorching the "Fabled" who thought of themselves as hunters
-AOJ's developers intervened in the "Genex's" evolution
-The "Genex" turned into "Real Genex"
・To create a new energy source for the "Ally of Justice" machines, the developers fused a "Real Reactor" into the bodies of certain "Genex". The "Genex" who were able to absorb this reactor turned into the "Real Genex"
-Gungnir, Unsealed
・The Surface World became even more chaotic by the day from the threat of not only the "Worms" but also the "Fabled". To fight against the swarm of invading "Worms" that know no rest and the sneaky "Fabled", the Ice Barrier released the Second Ice Dragon
・Unsealed at last, Gungnir celebrated its renewed freedom by flying towards the battlefield. Its breath turned the invaders and evil gods into frozen statues
-"Dragunity" appears in "Mist Valley"
・After leaving the AOJ, "Mist Valley" fought alone against the invaders. The most powerful force that the "Mist Valley" controlled, the "Mist Wurms", fell one after another. In the face of certain annihilation, the legendary dragoons arrived to help
・The "Dragunity" lived in the "Mist Valley", but their very existence had over time came to be treated as a myth. Their "Dragon Mastery" (Dragon Controlling Technique, TCG...) that had been passed down through the generations allowed them to fuse their hearts and bodies with the Dragons, turning into the powerful "Dragunity Knights"
-The "Worms" began to disperse
-To build "Decisive Arms", the other "Ally of Justice" productions were reduced tremendously
-"Decisive Arms" completed, its controlling center commanded by "Real Genex Controller"
-Final Battle Against the "Worms"
・Strangely, the "Worms" began to disperse. Feeling that something was amiss, the AOJ hurried their efforts to create the ultimate weapon. In the end, the horror came to be realized, and a gigantic "Worm" of terror and fear unlike any before it appeared.
・At the same time as the ultimate weapon's development, "Ally of Justice" machines with the sole purpose of investigation like "D.D. Checker" and "Cycle Reader" were also developed. These machines detected a new "Worm" appearance as seen in "Worm Call"
・"Worm Zero", a being of absolute despair ripped open space to manifest itself. "Zero" absorbed its brethren but at the same time mass produce new armies. Everywhere it went death and destruction followed, corrupting the land.
・"Ally of Justice Decisive Arms" was finished. This superdreadnaught class floating cannon was designed with the express purpose of releasing the maximum amount of firepower and artillery at the same time as the enemy appeared. In the final battle against "Zero", it sacrificed itself by using all of its power to wipe out not only "Zero", but the remaining "Worms"
-The joy of wiping out the "Worms" was not to last long, for the "Fabled" began their real invasion
-The appearance of the "Fabled Beasts"
・Happiness is never lasting, after watching the final battle against the "Worms" from the sidelines, the "Fabled" lead their "Fabled Beasts" to begin their real conquest of the world
・Perhaps it was because of the years of warfare on the Surface, but the borderline between the Surface World and Fabled World slowly declined until it ceased to exist altogether. The vanguards for the "Fabled", the "Fabled Beast", invaded the Surface like it was nothing, and used their superior powers to threaten the Surface Tribes
-AOJ researchers started militarizing the "Genex"
-To do this, they once more called for the help of the "Mist Valley", whom agreed to come back
-The creation of "Ally Genex"
-All the tribes tried their hand at creating the "Ally Genex"
-"Ally Genex Triforce" and "Ally Genex Triarm" were completed, and were sent into battle
・Against the threat of the "Fabled", it was obvious that the old machines the AOJ had no longer sufficed. So, the researchers began trying their hands at a concept they've only had but never actually tried, the militarization of the "Genex". In the end, it succeeded and the "Ally Genex" were born
・The "Ally Genex" are made of three parts: the body made out of old "Ally of Justice" machines, the control system controlled by the "Genex", and the energy source powered by the reactors of "Real Genex"
・The tribes all created their own "Ally Genex" based on its base concept. In the process of development, the tribes also worked together to create new machines
・"Ally Genex Reviver" made by the "XX-Saber", "Ally Genex Bellflame" made by the "Flamvell", "Ally Genex Birdman" made by the "Mist Valley", and "Ally Genex Solid" made by the "Ice Barrier"
・"Ally Genex Triforce" was made by a cooperation between "XX-Saber" and "Flamvell". Its right arm weapon can rotate and change to suit the battle situation
・"Ally Genex Triarm" was made by a cooperation between "Ice Barrier" and "Mist Valley". Its "Real Genex" reactor was able to operate at a capacity beyond originally thought possible
-The "Fabled" ranked-up their assault on the "Jurrac"
-The overwhelming power of the "Fabled" was too much for the "Jurrac". More and more the flames that once burned in their homeland were distinguished, until one day only about half remained. Realizing that they cannot let it end like this, the "Jurrac" let loose their final assault
-Those "Jurrac" who remained combined their flames together to create "Meteor" which fell with ferocity from the sky. The "Jurrac Impact" created a sea of fire, burning up not only the "Fabled", but also the home of the "Jurrac". It was in these flames that the "Neo Flamvell" were born
-The power of "Jurrac Meteor" annihilate a large portion of the "Fabled" forces, forcing them to retreat
-The souls of the "Jurrac" who lost their bodies combined with their flames to turn into the "Neo Flamvell"
-The cries of the residents of fire awakened "Ancient God Flamvell", an ancient deity from the time of mythology. Responding to their calls, "Ancient God Flamvell" used its tremendous power to incinerate the remaining "Fabled" that were in the "Jurrac" homeland
-After losing a great part of their forces in the battle against the "Jurrac", the "Fabled" actually intensified their attacks all around the world
-To fight against the "Fabled", "Ice Barrier" was split between two factions: to unseal Trishula or not
・Trishula released: The endless battles on the surface worn out the residents beyond belief. To end it once and for all, some within the "Ice Barrier" began to call for liberation of "Trishula". Although the dissenting faction was strong, in the end "Trishula" was released
・To release all of the seals put on "Trishula", the most power casters of the "Ice Barrier" gathered in one place. "Geomancer", "Dai-sojo", and "Medium" spent an entire month without rest and finally undid all of the seals carefully
・"Trishula's" powers are great, and managed to wipe out all the "Fabled" on the Surface World with ease. And yet soon enough, "Trishula" broke free from "Ice Barrier's" control, and went on an unstoppable rampage. As if to resonate with it, "Brionac" and "Gungnir" broke free as well, joining it in rampaging
-To reseal the Three Dragons, all options have been exhausted
・The "Triangle" formed by the "Generals of Ice Barrier" failed to contain the Dragons, and the "Tiger Kings" who were said to rival the Dragons in power could not take on all three at once. Further, even the "Mirror" proved useless


Age 1.5 ("Noellia's" Corruption - the Creation of "Ritua")

-The conflict within the "Ice Barrier" intensifies
-"Noellia" and "Natalia" failed in their Ritual for the "Invers" power
・The two mages of "Ice Barrier", "Noellia" and "Natalia": As "Ice Barrier" discussed whether or not to release "Trishula", it internally split into two factions. "Noellia" and "Natalia" were childhood friends, and although "Natalia" belonged to the family of the Release Faction and "Noellia" the family of the Dissenting Faction, they worked together to find a new power that could rival that of "Trishula"
・To find a power great enough to overcome the "Fabled", "Noellia" and "Natalia" set their sights on the demons that were sealed away long ago in the Ancient Era, the "Invers". The two attempted to use the "Ice Barrier" style containment techniques like the one the "Mirror" holds to conduct the summoning ritual
・The power of the "Invers" were too great for the two to contain, and "Natalia" tragically lost her life
・Not only did she lose her best friend, "Noellia" also became possessed by the evil spirit of the "Invers"
・"Natalia" was not only the best friend of "Noellia", she was also the mother of "Avance". Perhaps it was because of her deep regret at leaving behind her young child, her spirit essence still linger in this world
-"Trishula" was released
-"Trishula's" rampage creates an unimaginable amount of casualties
-"Ancient God Flamvell" fell to "Trishula"
-"Sacred Spirit of the Ice Barrier", a guardian spirit that had been protecting the "Ice Barrier" for generations, used the last of its lingering powers to seal away all Three Dragons at once
・"Prior of the Ice Barrier" was a legendary figure that sealed away the Three Ice Dragons on top of a Ice Mountain in eras long forgotten using the "Mirror of the Ice Barrier". He then created the "Ice Barrier", an organization whose sole purpose is to protect the seal. His spirit ascendent to become the "Sacred Spirit" after dying.
-After resealing the Three Dragons again, "Sacred Spirit" finally leaves this world for good
-After the war finally ended, "Noellia" adopted the many children who were orphaned from the Fabled War. Among those were the children of her fallen "Ice Barrier" comrades, as well as the son of "Natalia", "Avance"
・The "Gusta" children such as "Reeze" and "Caam" were safely sent back to their tribe from "Noellia's" protection
-"Noellia" leaves the "Ice Barrier"
-As the evil spirit of the "Invers" corrupted "Noellia" further, she began to research the forbidden arts. Years later, she took with her the children that she was teaching to use the arts like "Emilia" and "Avance", stole the "Ice Barrier" treasure "Mirror", and left the "Ice Barrier"
-Corrupting the form of the "Mirror", "Noellia" completed the "Ritua Aquamirror". It is capable of controlling and inducing all kinds of Ritual Effects
-"Noellia" forms the new organization based around the Forbidden Ritual Arts, the "Ritua"
